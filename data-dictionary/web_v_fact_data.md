(1)	Area as intersection of the main area and the subarea.     
(2)	Example, if marine layer = 1, then main_area_if is the foreign key to table web_EEZ,      
(3)	Depends on the marine layer.     
(4)	Note that the field names are different: Catch_*type*_id and catch_*status*.     
(5)	Price that fishermen get (not the price that client pay in fish store).     
(6)	Catch must be understood as the caught biomass in that context.     



### Values
