# web_commercial_groups



Commercial groups: Groups of similar ‘species’ with respect to their form, size, taxonomy, ecology in relation to their exploitation / commercialization.

Note: ‘species’ is used above for taxon/taxa or group of taxa as indicated by FAO for the ASFIS Species List http://www.fao.org/fishery/collection/asfis/en), where it can be species, genus, family, … up to phylum, or non-taxonomic groups. In that table, they are groups equal to or higher than family level.
