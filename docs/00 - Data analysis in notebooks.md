## Why?

Often users download data in order to perform basic analysis on that data. For example - what is the recent 10 year trend in my region, what are top 10 commercial groups in my sector etc. Jupyter notebooks allow the users to perform this analysis within the notebook itself, without having to download the data or using yet another application for analysis after download. This streamlines the data analysis process and saves valuable time and resources for the users.       

## How?

Pandas library in Python is a powerful tool for data analysis. Especially, data frames allow us to easily analyze data present in databases, CSV files etc. Once the data is in a data frame, it is easy to perform tasks such as data cleaning and data wrangling as required. Please refer to `notebooks` section in this repository for instructions on using Pandas library in different data analysis scenarios. Refer to the official documentation at `https://pandas.pydata.org/` for additional details about the wide range of data analysis functionality provided by `pandas` library.
