## Why?

Visualizations are a key tool in the analysis of data. Data analysis tasks such as relative comparison of performance indicators, identification of patterns and trends present in data can be done much more easily using visual indicators compared to numerical data representation in tables and data frames.

### widgets

Visualizations allow the users to easily perform comparisons and help in identifying patterns or trends present in the data. However static visualizations fail to provide the flexibility to the users who would like to perform analysis dynamically based on user input. Widgets in Python support flexible data analysis by allowing the users to interact with visualization elements and help in dynamically updating the data that is driving the visualizations.



## How?

Python provides several visualization libraries, and Altair is one of the latest additions to this list. Though some other libraries offer more flexibility and complexity in visual design â€“ the ease of use, intuitive methodology, and the relatively easy learning curve makes Altair library one of the best solutions for quick visualizations and analysis. Refer to Getting Started, User Guide, Gallery and Advanced Usage sections at `https://altair-viz.github.io/` for further details.          

IPYwidgets in Python can be used to allow Jupyter notebook users to easily interact with certain visualization elements as needed. For example, a user can select the range of years and a region using dropdowns in IPYwidgets to limit and focus the analysis on a certain period and a country. Refer to `https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/` for additional details on usage and instructions.      

Some example charts, widgets can be found in the `notebooks` section of this repository. Code behind the charts incorporates different elements - definition & display of widgets, definition & display of charts, and also the functionality to download data behind the charts.
